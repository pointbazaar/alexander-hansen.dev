	<h2>Grinding Wheel Arbor - 2022</h2>
	
	<p>I picked up a cheap Grinding Wheel at the Store, but it 
		lacked an Arbor. I tried using a bolt, but it would not 
		run true because no bolt had the exact diameter.
		<br>
		<br>
		So I made this Arbor on the Lathe.

	<h2>Dremel Tool Holder for the Lathe - 2022</h2>
	
	<p>I had this Proxxon IBS/E Dremel Tool laying around,
		and was wondering how to use it on the Lathe.
		<br>
		<br>
		It was easy to make a Toolholder using the Lathe and 
		Drill Press.
		<br>
		The Bore is about 19.8 mm. The Part going in the Toolholder 
		is around 8mm thick, the regular size for this Lathe.
		<br>
		The important part is that the center of the bore
		should be on the line created by the top of the toolholder.
		<br>
		This is so that the axis of the Dremel is on the same height
		as the axis of the Lathe.
	</p>

	<h2>Lathe Toolpost Handle Extension/Lever - 2022</h2>
	
	<p> The Toolpost Handle on my Lathe, which is used 
		to clamp the Toolpost at the correct Angle
		or just switch to a different Tool by rotating it a
		1/4 turn, is a little short.
		<br>
		So it is hard to use it and the Hand can slip and you
		get a bruise. 
		<br>
		Thankfully there is a simple Solution
		<br>
		We machine a Handle Extension from Aluminum.
		<br>
		The hole should have been 10.8 mm, 
		<br>
		I used an 11 mm Drill, it came out 11.1 mm.
		<br>
		But with some duct tape we can create a tight fit.
		<br>
		While this is a quick fix, we can also
		create an even better solution in the future,
		by machining a new handle from scratch, which 
		would probably also look better.
		<br>
		Before you lecture me, i don't have a reamer of the correct size
		or a boring bar for such small holes. 
		So i don't see a way for how i should have brought the
		hole to size.
