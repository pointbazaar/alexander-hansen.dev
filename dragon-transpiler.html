	<h4> Dragon Transpiler Project</h4>


	<p>
		The Dragon Transpiler Project is a spinoff of my failed Dragon
		 Compiler Project.
		 <br>
		 Instead of creating a full compiler with frontend and backend,
		 I want to create a transpiler from the Dragon Language 
		 to C. Maybe also to Java. 
		 <br>
		 This has several Advantages:
		 <ul>
			<li>not implement something which has already been implemented</li>
			<li>build on top of existing ecosystem.</li>
			<li>enable people to have efficient C code which can be modified
			</li>
			<li>
				write most of the code at a higher level. But still be able
				to go down towards the lower level, without using
				a big language like C++ with it's many complexities.
			</li>
		 </ul>
		 
		 C builds on top of Assembly Language. It is an abstraction thereof.
		 <br>
		 Why not build an even higher level Language on top of C?
		 <br>
		 Most Languages that are higher level than C are not implemented
		 on top of it.
