		The Lean Startup (by Eric Ries)
	</a>
	<p>
		The Lean Startup Method is a Way of building Startups that embraces <strong>validated Learning</strong>
		and <strong>Product / Customer Development</strong>. Instead of having a rigid Vision about the Product / Service

		If something does not work, try something else.

		Test-Driven Development By Example (by Kent Beck)
	</a>
	<p>
		If you are anything like me, you like Programming. 
		Sadly we as people tend to make Mistakes(Bugs). <br>
		
		In any <strong>professional Endeavour </strong>, Professionals 
		check and double-check their work to achieve the best Results, consistently.
		
		Only if the Foundation is good, we can build on top of it.
		<strong>Tests</strong> (along with static typing and other stuff) are the Method by which we Programmers 
		can ensure the Quality of our Work. Don't live in Fear. Test your Code.

		The Clean Coder (by Robert C. Martin)
	</a>
	
	<p>
		This Book talks about <strong>the human side of Software Development</strong>.
		If you think Programming just has to do with Computers, you are mistaken!
		If you want to spend all day doing what you love (programming) and also like to get paid for it,
		<strong>learning to effectively and efficiently deal with Humans in the Context of Software is a good Idea.</strong>
