	<p>
		I don't have time to pursue every project that comes to mind,
		and i want to put some ideas out there.
	</p>
	<p>
		If you find something that already implements what i described,
		please let me know via email.

	<h3>comcat</h3>
	Like 'cat', but it just filters out the comments from source files for many languages.
	<br>
	I see no real use for it besides being a fun project.
	
	<hr>
	<h3>depcat</h3>
	Like 'cat', but it just filters out the dependencies from source files for many languages.
	<br>
	This would be useful especially for multi-language projects and especially 
	from a security/performance perspective.
	To see if you are using multiple versions of the same library.
	 
	<hr>
	<h3>strcat</h3>
	Like 'cat', but it just filters out the strings from source files for many languages.
	<br>
	Similar to how 'strings' extracts strings from binaries.
	
	<hr>
	<h3>salloc C Library</h3>
	which can allocate dynamically on the heap, <br>
	but on a per function
	basis. 
	So that the stuff allocated in a function can be freed,
	without having to free everything individually.
	<br>
	Similar to how you can allocate statically inside your stackframe,
	this Library would enable you to allocate dynamically.
	<br>
	
	<pre>

int f(){
	
	//...
	
	int* arr = salloc(sizeof(int)*4);  //(1)
	
	char* t = salloc(sizeof(char)*8); //(2)
	
	//...
	
	sreturn(3); //would free (1), (2)
}
	</pre>
