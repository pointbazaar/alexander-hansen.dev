		<h1>Don't waste your Time with Scripting Languages</h1>
		<p>
			Programming Languages, Formal Languages, Domain Specific Languages 
			and Languages in General can be classified in many ways.
			One of which is the distinction between 
			<ul>
				<li>scripting language</li>
				<li>application development language</li>
				<li>general-purpose programming language</li>
				<li>systems development language</li>
			</ul>
			Of course, a language can be in more than one of these categories.
			When reading the recommendations below, consider
			that for each category of application, there are 
			way more suitable Programming Languages than listed.
		</p>

		<h3>Languages for Application Development</h3>

		<p>
			When creating a program, one should consider which language to choose.
			For most cases that would be C++.
			<br>
			When creating a desktop application with a GUI, or a backend for a 
			web application, an application development language like <strong>Java</strong>
			or <strong>C# (Opensource Mono)</strong> or <strong>C++</strong> would be a good choice.

			
		</p>

		<h3>Languages for (embedded) system development</h3>
		<p>
			When creating a (maybe embedded) system, an operating system, or any application where 
			performance is important, <strong>C</strong> or <strong> C++ </strong>
			or <strong>Rust</strong> would be appropriate.
		</p>

		<h3>Programming Languages which are almost always appropriate</h3>

		<p>
			<strong>C++</strong>. Because it can perform all tasks, low-level and high-level,
			runs inside the browser through WebAssembly, and has a long track record
			of reliable, secure and fast Applications.
		</p>

		<h3>Programming Languages which are <strong>always inappropriate</strong></h3>
		<p>
			<ul>
				<li>PHP</li>
				<li>Python</li>
				<li>Javascript (always inappropriate, use WebAssembly in the Browser)</li>
				
			</ul>
			These scripting languages are <strong>dynamically typed</strong> and lack structure.
			They are <strong>inefficient and error-prone</strong> to work with. On top of that,
			they are <strong>interpreted and slow</strong>. 
		</p>

		 <h3>But XYZ uses a scripting language!</h3>
		
		 <p>
		 	Well either they are inexperienced, their project is small, 
		 	or they don't mind their program being slow.
		 </p>

		<h3>But Scripting Language XYZ is in demand and has a lot of Job Opportunities!</h3>
		<p>
			<a href="https://karriere.mcdonalds.de/index">McDonalds </a>
			also has a lot of job openings. Do you want to work at McDonalds?
			I don't think so. Low pay, bad working conditions, low-quality Products, 
			bad team culture,...
			<br>
			Same story for all scripting jobs.		
		</p> 

		<h3>Use Webassembly instead of Javascript</h3>
