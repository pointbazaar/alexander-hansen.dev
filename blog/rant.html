	<h2> What annoys me about the current Programming ecosystem</h2>
	<br>
	
	<h4>Programmers embracing worse technology (Python, NodeJS, PHP)</h4>
	
	<p>
		You probably know one or two of them. <br>
		They talk about Javascript and how it's so great and about Python and so on.<br>
		But these are not serious Programming Languages to do Projects in. <br>
		They are 
		Scripting Languages for writing really small stuff that's eventually
		going to be deleted.<br>
		
		Professional Programmers should be using professional Programming Languages.<br>
		
		Good, professional, modern languages should:
		<ul>
			<li> not be fully interpreted, maybe bytecode-interpreted, but not interpreted at the source level</li>
			<li> have a static Type System where variables actually have a Type</li>
			<li> ... </li>
		</ul>
		
		Javascript is just neccessary sometimes because it's an easy way to get 
		some small stuff going in the Browser. <br>
		But it should only be used for that. 
	</p>
	
	<h4>Reflection in Java, Overuse of Annotations, Kotlin</h4>
	<p>
		Who needs it? I never used it knowingly actually. <br>
		How many Programmers do you know that can actually use Threads?<br>
		How many that have actually read kernel source code? <br>
		
		In my Opinion, Java is getting worse with so many people
		just creating Annotations left and right. <br>
		
		Using Annotations and Reflection is just a really
		inflexible way to program. <br>
		
		Just look at Spring Boot. The most ugly outgrowth of the Java Enterprise 
		Ecosystem. <br>
		Filled to the brim with unneccessary Annotations, slow as can be,
		and actually understood by very few people. 
	</p>
	
	<h4>The Spring Framework : When Frameworks get Diabetes</h4>
	<p>
		I don't know what they had in mind with the Spring Framework.<br>
		Maybe they just wanted to take the life energy from innocent Programmers.<br>
		<br>
		
		With many of the most common things you can do in Backend Development,<br>
		the Spring Framework takes them, and makes them harder to use. <br>
		Like using xml to configure Software Components. <br>
		The whole Software just becomes so much harder to maintain,<br>
		because Spring Boot is so opinionated. <br>
		Everything has to be done in some particular way.<br>
		And did they tell you? They have a special feature for almost EVERYTHING.<br>
		They are literally trying to swallow the whole of backend dev and put it into their Framework.<br>
		
		Let me tell you something... that never works. <br>
		No Framework can do everything for you. <br>
		<br>
		
		Spring / Spring Boot isn't gonna save you. <br>
		It cannot replace actual Programming Skill and 
		Knowledge about various libraries.

	<h4>Docker </h4>
	<p>
		I actually wrote a seperate Blog Post about why Docker is bad.
	</p>
	
	<h4>Other</h4>
	<ul>
		<li>Any dynamically typed language that does not do typechecking</li>
		
		<li>CSS (they made it unneccessarily complicated, try to just use Bootstrap)</li>
		
	</ul>
