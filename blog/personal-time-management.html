	<h1>Personal Time Management</h1>
	<p>
		I've just always found it to be an interesting topic. Not that i'm particularly good at it or anything.
		<br>
		This Post is just a collection of Resources for how to manage your time. If you got any ideas or find a mistake, 
		please email me.
	</p>
	
	
	<h3 id="goals">Goals</h3>
	<p>
		You gotta have Goals, otherwise it makes no sense to manage your time at all. <br>
		However, the Goals themselves (and especially how they are worded) influences our ability
		to achieve them.<br><br>
		In my Opinion, good Goals have a few things in common. They are:
		<ul>
			<li><strong>achievable</strong></li>
			<li><strong>motivating</strong></li>
			<li><strong>incrementally achievable</strong></li>
			<li><strong>final (once achieved, they cannot be un-achieved)</strong></li>
		</ul>
	</p>
	
	<h5>incrementally achievable Goals</h5>
	<p>
		Even the biggest Goals can be broken down into small steps. <br>
		To achieve big Goals, most of the time they have to be broken down into:
		<ul>
			<li>yearly Goals</li>
			<ul>
				<li>quarterly Goals</li>
				<ul>
					<li>monthly/weekly Goals</li>
					<ul>
						<li>daily Tasks</li>
					</ul>
				</ul>
			</ul>
		</ul>
		
		Some Goals are so big, that they require a multi-year effort from many people. (e.g. Manhattan Project, Linux Kernel Development, Infrastructure Projects)
	</p>
	
	<h5>final Goals</h5>
	<p>
		What discourages People, is when they are working for something, and then it disappears right when they
		achieved it. <br>
		
		
	</p>
	
	<h3 id="estimate">Effort Estimation</h3>
	<p>
		To achieve your Goals, you can break them down into smaller and smaller Tasks.<br>
		Then you can estimate how long each task could take, label them, and then execute.<br>
		This way, you avoid overworking yourself or trying to do too much in one day.<br>
		Big Tasks (>= 1 day) can in my opinion only be realistically estimated by
		estimating the small tasks they are made up of, and then calculating the sum.<br>
	</p>
	<p>
		Then after some time, you find out how much of your "estimated task time" you can
		execute in one day. This is your real work time capability. And surprise surprise, it will
		never be exactly 8 hours. It also depends on the Tasks you are doing.
	</p>
	
	<h3 id="focus">Focus</h3>
	
	<p>
		When you try to do too much, or too many things, you end up getting less done. <br>
		It is better to focus on a few things, and do them right. <br>
		For example, don't try to:
		<ul>
			<li> work multiple day jobs /part time jobs (you can make more $ working a single job)</li>
			<li> learn multiple programming languages at once </li>
			<li> work a full time job and be a full time student </li>
		</ul>
	</p>
	
	<h3 id="priority">Priority</h3>
	
	<p>
		When you combine your Task Management with Priorities, you never have to think about what to do first.<br>
		Every Task should have the Priority of it's parent task.<br>
		Example:
		<ul>
			<li>Project A [5h] [Priority A]
				<ul>
					<li>Task 1 [2h]</li>
					<li>Task 2 [3h]</li>
				</ul>
			</li>
			<li>Project B [6h] [Priority B]
				<ul>
					<li>Task 3 [1h]</li>
					<li>Task 4 [5h]</li>
				</ul>
			</li>
		</ul>
		From this Overview of your Projects you can then make a plan for
		your day. Let's say you are confident to be able to do 4h of tasks.<br>
		
		Just take Task 2 and Task 3.
