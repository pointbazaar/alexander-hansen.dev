		<h1>Flow of Control in Programming Languages</h1>
		<p>
			In this article i will talk about common flow-of-control statements
			aswell as conditional expressions.
			
		</p>
		<p>
			Expressions compute values, Statements execute some code.
			Functional Programming Languages like haskell rely mostly on 
			conditionals in the Form of Expressions, while imperative
			and object-oriented languages compute Values by using
			flow-of-control statements.
			
			So, by using conditionals in the form of expressions, and recursion,
			we can tell the compiler the rules about the computation of the value.
			In this way, there is more freedom for the language to decide how
			the value is computed. Improvements and optimizations are easier.
			
			But (in practise, not in theory) we lose some of the optimizations 
			which could have been
			thought of by the programmer in a more imperative language.
